*Alphabet Soup*

Alfredo Spaghetti really likes soup, especially when it contains
alphabetpasta. Every day he constructs a sentence from letters, places the
letters intoa bowl of broth and enjoys delicious alphabet soup.

Today, after constructing the sentence, Alfredo remembered that the
FacebookHacker Cup starts today! Thus, he decided to construct the phrase
"HACKERCUP".As he already added the letters to the broth, he is stuck with the
letters heoriginally selected. Help Alfredo determine how many times he
canplace the word "HACKERCUP" side-by-side using the letters in his soup.

oftest cases. T lines follow, each representing a single test case with a
sequenceof upper-case letters and spaces: the original sentence Alfredo
constructed.

*Output*

t is the test case number (starting from 1) and n is the number of timesthe
word "HACKERCUP" can be placed side-by-side using the letters from
thesentence.

*Constraints*
